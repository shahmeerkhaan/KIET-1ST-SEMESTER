		<h3><b>History of Periodic Table</h3>
		<p>
		The Periodic Table contains 118 elements on  it with their maas number and atomic number respectively, and If you asks most of the chemists 
		who discovered the periodic table and you will almost certainly get the answer Dmitri Mendeleev.Certainly Mendeleev was the first to 
		publish a version of the table that we would recognise today, but does he deserveall the credit?A number of other chemists before 
		Mendeleev were investigating patterns in the properties of the elements that were knownat the time. The earliest attempt to classify 
		the elements was in 1789, when Antoine Lavoisier grouped the elements based on their properties into gases, non-metals, metals and earths.
		Several other attempts were made to group elements together over the coming decades. In 1829, Johann Döbereiner recognised triads of 
		elements with chemically similar properties, such as lithium, sodium and potassium, and showed that the properties of the middle element
		could be predicted from the properties of the other two.It was not until a more accurate list of the atomic mass of the elements became 
		available at a conference in Karlsruhe, Germany in 1860 that real progress was made towards the discovery of the modern periodic table.

		<h3><b>Development of the periodic table</h3>
		<p>
		Chemists have always looked for ways of arranging the elements to reflect the similarities between their properties.
		The modern periodic table lists the elements in order of increasing atomic number (the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom).
		Historically, however, relative atomic masses were used by scientists trying to organise the elements. This was mainly because the 
		idea of atoms being made up of smaller sub-atomic particles (protons, neutrons and electrons) had not been developed. Nevertheless, 
		the basis of the modern periodic table was well established and even used to predict the properties of undiscovered elements long 
		before the concept of the atomic number was developed.
