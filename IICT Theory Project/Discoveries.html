				<h3>Corona Virus Vaccine.</h3>
				<p>
					Coronavirus vaccines can be inactivated coronavirus, live attenuated coronavirus, or S protein-based.
				</p>
				<p>
					Besides, there are still vectored vaccines, DNA vaccines, and combination vaccines against coronaviruses. 
					Vaccines targeting several animal CoVs have been developed, and some have been demonstrated to be efficacious in preventing viral infection.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, a phenomenon of enhanced disease following vaccination has been observed in cats upon infection with feline infectious peritonitis virus 
					following previous infection, vaccination, or passive transfer of antibody.

					<h2>Effects of Covid on World of Discoveries.</h2>
					<p>
						COVID-19 has turned the world upside down. Everything has been impacted. How we live and interact with each other, 
						how we work and communicate, how we move around and travel. Every aspect of our lives has been affected. 
						Decisions made now and in the coming months will be some of the most important made in generations.
						Due to the increase of Covid, the world of Discoveries has been affected alot as the ratio of discoveries 
						as compare to past years has been decreased.
