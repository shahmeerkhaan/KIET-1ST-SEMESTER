			<h3><b> History of NASA and it's begining. </b></h3>
			<p>
			When NASA began 60 years ago, we had questions about the universe humans had been asking since we first looked up into the night sky.
			In the six decades since, NASA, along with its international partners and thousands of researchers, have expanded our knowledge of the
			Universe by using a full fleet of telescopes and satellites. From the early probes of the 1950s and 1960s to the great telescopes of the 
			1990s and 21st century, NASA scientists have been exploring the evolution of the universe from the Big Bang to the present.
			</p>
			<h3><b> The great Observatries of NASA </b></h3>
			<p>
			NASA astronomers use several kinds of telescopes in space and on the ground. Each observes targets like stars, planets, and galaxies,
			but captures different wavelengths of light using various techniques to add to our understanding of these cosmic phenomenon. 
			<p><b>Some of their machineries which do the observations are:</b></p>
			<p><b>1. Hubble </b></p>
			<p><b>2. Chandra X-ray Observatory </b></p>
			<p><b>3. Spitzer Space Telescope</b></p>

					<p>
					Recently they discovered that our universe is 13.77 billion years old and to determine 
					that atoms make up only 4.6 percent of the universe, with the remainder being dark matter 
					and dark energy. Using telescopes like Hubble and Spitzer, scientists also now know how fast 
					the universe is expanding. <b> They recently launched sentinel 6 for another discovery.</b>
