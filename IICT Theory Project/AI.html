				<h3><b>Qualities of artificial intelligence</b></h3>
				<p>
				1. On A.I Although there is no uniformly agreed upon definition.
				<br>
				2.  AI generally is thought to refer to
				“machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, 
				given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention.”
				</p>
				<p>
				3. According to researchers Shubhendu and Vijay, these software systems “make decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise” 
				and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up.
				<br>
				4. As such, they operate in an intentional, intelligent, and adaptive manner.
				</p>
				<h3><b>Intentionality</b></h3>
				<p>
				Artificial intelligence algorithms are designed to make decisions, often using 
				real-time data. They are unlike passive machines that are capable only of 
				mechanical or predetermined responses. Using sensors, digital data, or 
				remote inputs, they combine information from a variety of different sources,
				analyze the material instantly, and act on the insights derived from those 
				data. With massive improvements in storage systems, processing speeds, 
				and analytic techniques, they are capable of tremendous sophistication in
				analysis and decisionmaking.
				</p>
				<h3><b>Details on their intelligence</b></h3>
				<p>
				AI generally is undertaken in conjunction with machine learning and data 
				analytics.5 Machine learning takes data and looks for underlying trends. If it
				spots something that is relevant for a practical problem, software designers 
				can take that knowledge and use it to analyze specific issues. All that is
				required are data that are sufficiently robust that algorithms can discern 
				useful patterns. Data can come in the form of digital information, satellite 
				imagery, visual information, text, or unstructured data.
				</p>
				<h3><b>Adaptability</b></h3>
				<p>
				AI systems have the ability to learn and adapt as they make decisions. In the
				transportation area, for example, semi-autonomous vehicles have tools that 
				let drivers and vehicles know about upcoming congestion, potholes, highway
				construction, or other possible traffic impediments. Vehicles can take 
				advantage of the experience of other vehicles on the road, without human
				involvement, and the entire corpus of their achieved “experience” is 
				immediately and fully transferable to other similarly configured vehicles. 
				Their advanced algorithms, sensors, and cameras incorporate experience in
				current operations, and use dashboards and visual displays to present 
				information in real time so human drivers are able to make sense of 
				ongoing traffic and vehicular conditions. And in the case of fully autonomous
				vehicles, advanced systems can completely control the car or truck, and 
				make all the navigational decisions.

					<p>
					Artificial Intelligence (AI), or machine intelligence, is the field developing computers and robots capable of parsing data 
					contextually to provide requested information, supply analysis, or trigger events based on findings. Through techniques like 
					machine learning and neural networks, companies globally are investing in teaching machines to ‘think’ more like humans.
