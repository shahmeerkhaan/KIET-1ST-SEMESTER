			<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
			<p>
			Since World War II 'information' has emerged
			as a fundamental scientific and technological
			concept applied to phenomena ranging from
			black holes to DNA, from the organization of
			cells to the processes of human thought, and
			from the management of corporations to the
			allocation of global resources. In addition to
			reshaping established disciplines, it has
			stimulated the formation of a panoply of new
			subjects and areas of inquiry concerned with
			its structure and its role in nature and society	
			(Machlup and Mansfeld 1983). Theories based
			on the concept of 'information' have so
			permeated modern culture that it now is
			widely taken to characterize our times. We
			live in an 'information society', an 'age of
			information'. Indeed, we look to models of
			information processing to explain our own
			patterns of thought. And through the time 
			during the world war 2 a commputer got established
			by a great mathematician "Allan Turing" who broke the 
			unbreakable code "Enigma" of "germans" in "WW II" and
			then after that the start of gathering information in 
			computers start through the time it got more advanced
			after the invention of internet.

			<h3><b>Computing's Present History</b></h3>
			<p>
			1. Where the current literature in the history of
			computing is self-consciously historical, it
			focuses in large part on hardware and on the
			pre-history and early development of the
			computer.
			2. Where it touches on later
			developments or provides a wider view, it is
			only incidentally historical. A major portion of
			the literature stems from the people involved,
			either through regular surveys of the state and
			development of various fields (e.g. Rosen
			1967, Sammet 1969)3. 
			or compilations of
			seminal papers (Randell 1982; Yourdon 1979,
			1982; AT&T 1987),4. 
			or through
			reminiscences and retrospectives, either
			written directly or transcribed from their
			contributions to conferences and symposia.5
			Biographies of men or machines --some
			heroic, some polemical, some both-- are a
			prominent genre, and one reads a lot about
			"pioneers". A few corporate histories have
			appeared, most notably IBM's Early
			Computers (Bashe et al. 1986), but they too
			are in-house productions.
